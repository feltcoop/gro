> opinionated tools for web development

```ts
// work in progress
```

## motivation

I want a web dev tool that:

- shares my opinions
- has batteries included but minimal dependencies
- hides complexity but exposes it when needed
- works for many use cases like static sites, SPAs, webapp servers, etc
- provides solutions for things like auth, data fetching and storage, etc
- explores ideas like AOT compilation, codegen, data-driven development, etc
