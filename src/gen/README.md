## motivation

The `gro gen` command allows us to enhance our projects
with convention-based code generation (codegen) techniques.

Why? Codegen can produce game-changing results for UX and DX,
especially around performance, flexibility, consistency, and development speed.
As developers, automating our work is a natural and indispensable power,
and `gro gen` brings automation deeper into our code authoring workflows.

By convention, `gro gen` looks through `src/`
for any TypeScript files with `.gen.` in the file name,
and it outputs a file stripped of `.gen.` to the same directory.
The `*.gen.*` origin files export a `gen` function
that returns the contents of the output file.
More flexibility is available when needed
including custom file names, custom output directories,
and multiple output files.

Normally you'll want to commit generated files to git,
but you can always gitignore a specific pattern like `*.ignore.*`
and name the output files accordingly.
We may want to smooth out this use case in the future.

The implications of integrating codegen into our code authoring are deep.
One benefit is that it allows us to have a single source of truth for data
that would otherwise be scattered throughout our codebases
across many types of files (like JSON, HTML, SQL, etc),
without compromising any of our code's runtime characteristics.
We can also generate types, validators, tests,
and more by introspecting our data at buildtime.
The goal is to leverage automation to increase the power we wield over our code
with a straightforward developer experience.

**Be aware** â€” this is a sharp tool!
It adds a layer of indirection between the code you write and run.
Also, you could introduce security vulnerabilities
if you fail to escape certain inputs.
Importantly, there is no support for source maps right now.
Source maps could be added at some point, at least in many cases.

Inspirations include Lisp macros and
[Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte), a compiler for building UIs.
Svelte is the UI library integrated in
the parent project [Gro](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro).

## usage

The `gro gen` command looks for any files with `.gen.`
in the file name and tries to call an exported `gen`
function to generate one or more output files.

```bash
gro gen # runs codegen for all *.gen.* files in src/
```

> in the following examples,
> note that importing the `Gen` type is optional,
> but it makes for a better DX

### generate TypeScript

Given `src/script.gen.ts`:

```ts
import {Gen} from '@feltcoop/gro';

export const gen: Gen = () => {
	const message = 'generated!';
	return `console.log('${message}')`;
};
```

Outputs `src/script.ts`:

```ts
console.log('generated!');
```

### generate other filetypes

Files with any extension can be generated without configuration.
If the origin file name ends with the pattern `.gen.*.ts`,
the default output file name is stripped of its trailing `.ts`.
Given `src/markup.gen.html.ts`:

```ts
import {Gen} from '@feltcoop/gro';

export const gen: Gen = () => {
	const body = 'hi';
	return `
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<body>
				${body}
			</body>
		</html>
	`;
};
```

Outputs `src/markup.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		hi
	</body>
</html>
```

### generate a custom file name or write to a different directory

The `gen` function can return an object with custom configuration.
Given `src/somewhere/originalName.gen.ts`:

```ts
import {Gen} from '@feltcoop/gro';

export const gen: Gen = () => {
	const message = 'output path can be relative and name can be anything';
	return {
		contents: `console.log('${message}')`,
		fileName: '../elsewhere/otherName.ts',
	};
};
```

Outputs `src/elsewhere/otherName.ts`:

```ts
console.log('output path can be relative and name can be anything');
```

### generate multiple custom files

The `gen` function can also return an array of files.
Given `src/thing.gen.ts`:

```ts
import {Gen} from '@feltcoop/gro';

export const gen: Gen = () => {
	const fieldValue = 1;
	return [
		{
			contents: `
				import {Thing} from './types';
				export const isThing = (t: any): t is Thing => t?.field === ${fieldValue};
			`,
		},
		{
			contents: `export interface Thing { field: ${typeof fieldValue} }`,
			fileName: 'types.ts',
		},
		{
			contents: `{"field": ${fieldValue}}`,
			fileName: 'data/thing.json',
		},
	];
};
```

Outputs `src/thing.ts`:

```ts
import {Thing} from './types';
export const isThing = (t: any): t is Thing => t?.field === 1;
```

and `src/types.ts`:

```ts
export interface Thing {
	field: number;
}
```

and `src/data/thing.json`:

```json
{
	"field": 1
}
```
